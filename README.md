Some explanations for each button and the function which represents are the following :

### 1st Row
  1) abs : The absolute value of a number (e.g. abs(-5) = 5).
  2) mod : From modulo. it's the operation to find the remainder of the division of one number by another.
           In python we use the symbol % (e.g. 5mod2 = 5%2 = 1).
  3) div : Floor division returns the result of the division rounded down to the nearest integer.
           In python we use the symbol // (e.g. 8div3 = 8//3 = 2).
  4) x! : The factorial of the number x (e.g. 4! = 24).
  5) e : The Euler's number. A mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.
     
### 2nd Row
  1) sin : Sine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. sin(90)=1).
  2) cos : Cosine of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cos(180)=-1).
  3) tan : Tangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. tan(45)=1).
  4) cot : Cotangent of an angle θ in degrees (e.g. cot(45) = 1/tan(45) = 1).
  5) π : Archimedes' constant defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
       It is approximately equal to 3.14159.
     
### 3rd Row
  1) x2 : x raised to the power of 2 (e.g. 42 = 16).
  2) x3 : x raised to the power of 3 (e.g. 53 = 125).
  3) xn : x raised to any power (e.g. 24 = 16 ).
  4) x-1 : x raised to the power of (-1). The inverse of number x (e.g. 2-1 = 0.5).
  5) 10x : Powers of 10 (e.g. 103 = 1000).
     
### 4th Row
  1) 2√ : Square root of a number (e.g. 2√144 = 12).
  2) 3√ : Cube root of a number (e.g. 3√8 = 2).
  3) √ : Any root of a number (e.g. 4√16 = 2).
  4) log10 : The logarithm of a number with base 10 (e.g. log101000 = 3).
  5) ln : The logarithm of a number with base e (e.g. logee = ln e = 1).
     
### 5th Row
  1) ( : Left parenthesis.
  2) ) : Right parenthesis.
  3) ± : Change the sign of a number.
  4) % : Find the percentage of a number (e.g. 5% = 0.05).
  5) ex : Expotential function (e.g. e2=approx 7.389 ).
     
### 6th,7th,8th,9th Row
In these rows are :

  -> The basic number buttons (0 to 9).  
  -> The basic math symbols (operators) (+, -, *, /).  
  -> The equal sign (=) and point (.).  
  -> Button DEL to delete one or more from the end of the entry.  
  -> Button AC to delete the whole entry.  
  -> EXP : Multiply any number with powers of 10 (e.g. 2 * 10 ** 3 = 2000).
